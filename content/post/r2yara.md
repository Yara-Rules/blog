From [YaraRules Project](http://yara-rules.github.io/blog/) we would like to introduce you a new Yara module that pretends to use information retrieved from [radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2) (r2) to use with Yara.

To use this module it is important to know basic concepts about r2 and Yara.

You can find all the documentation about the installation of the module and use cases in the following link [https://r2yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://r2yara.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The code is available in our Github repository [https://github.com/Yara-Rules/r2yara](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/r2yara)

Do not hesitate to give us feedback or suggest new use cases and, of course, we invite you to collaborate with us.

Yara Rules Team.
