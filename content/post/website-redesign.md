Hello Yara lovers!

We have been very busy lately working on ways to improve the [YaraRules project](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules/) and the [online YaraRules Analyzer](https://analysis.yara-rules.github.io/blog/).

The first of the changes and improvements is the redesigned website that you are seeing right now. We have moved from [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in an effort of simplifying the web and its management.

But that is not the only thing we are working on. We are working also on the [YaraRules Analyzer](https://analysis.yara-rules.github.io/blog/) and the [YaraRules ruleset](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules/) and have planned some improvements that you will enjoy for sure.

Please take a look at the new website and tell us your impressions.

The [YaraRules](https://twitter.com/yararules) team.
