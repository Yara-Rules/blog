**NOTE**
YaraRules Analyzer project is no longer maintained.

At YaraRules Project we want to offer to the Community a new online service: “YaraRules Analyzer”. It allows you to analyze your files on the cloud using the full [YaraRules ruleset](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules/), so you do not need to install Yara in your local computer and you also make sure to analyze your files against the latest [YaraRules ruleset](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules/).

This service is still in an alpha stage, is available at https://analysis.yara-rules.github.io/blog/ and once you have uploaded the file to analyze, you can choose either to use the full ruleset or the rules from particular categories.

An example report of an analysis can be seen in [this link](https://analysis.yara-rules.github.io/blog/analysis/58046abbe41a9c2bde568701).

In this report you can consult the rule name, namespace (file name), matching strings, tags, meta information and even access to the source code of the matching rule in our GitHub repository.

By default, all analyses are public and everyone can access to them. To keep an analysis private, you have to become a registered user on the Web.

We recommend that you take a look at the Privacy Policy and Terms or Service and if you have any further questions please feel free to contact us at yararules@gmail.com.

We hope you find YaraRules Analyzer useful and do not hesitate to contact us if you have any suggestions.

Just a quick reminder: If you are interested in sharing your Yara rules with us and the Community, please [join our Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/ALAD2UZ1HxA0M37D94oeag), send us a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yararules), or submit a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules/).
