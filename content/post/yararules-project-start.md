This project arises out of the need to have a repository to compile different Yara signatures, classified and most up to date as possible.

[Yara](http://virustotal.github.io/yara/ "Yara Tool") is a tool increasingly used, but knowledge is dispersed, so one of the main objectives of the Yara Rules project is to offer a Yara ruleset as complete as possible to provide a quick way to get and update existing rules.

We hope it is useful for the Security Community and are looking forward for your feedback.

Regards,

The [YaraRules](https://twitter.com/yararules) team.
