      <description>For this forensics cases which are based in unreliable evidences, we decided to carry out the development of a carving tool for getting files from a raw disk using IoC detection.
YaraRET itâ€™s based in Radare2 and Yara, and it provides 58 magic number&amp;rsquo;s rules for detecting 58 types of files. This tool relies on the idea of a first stage detecting files using its magic numbers and a second stage, selecting or discarding those detected files using Yara, IoCs or its entropy value.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been long time without any updates here. Let&amp;rsquo;s publish some news. Yara-Rules project is proud to anounce another interesting tool for the comunity, it is Yara-Endpoint. It is a tool that has been designed for helping incident handlers during their daily job.
